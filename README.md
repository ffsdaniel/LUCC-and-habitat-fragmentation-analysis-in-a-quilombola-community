# Analysis of Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) and Habitat Fragmentation

This notebook presents the methodology used in a study on the analysis of land use and cover change (LUCC) and habitat fragmentation in a traditional quilombola community in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The work was carried out using Python 3.12 and libraries such as `geopandas`, `rasterio`, `scikit-learn`, `pylandstats` and `scipy`.

## Notebook Contents
- Land Use Classification using Random Forest**
- Habitat Fragmentation Analysis
